###  Overview
A user would like to be able to know whether or not three values they have can be used to construct a triangle. 
We'll create a form for them that can determine whether or not three values can create a triangle.
### Inputs
• The component structure created should be responsive\
• The user should not be able to get the user interface into an unrecoverable or non-sensical state\
• The user should not be able to change the state of the application while the result is being determined
### Button
• Provide a button below the inputs for the user to click\
• Click of the button should execute a method that determines whether or not the values entered by the user are a triangle\
###  The result should:
• Appear no less than one second and no more than 3 seconds after click of the button\
• Display "Yes, you can create a triangle" if the values provided can construct a triangle\
• Display "Sorry, you cannot create a triangle" if the values provided cannot construct a triangle
###  Additional Information
• The interface should be logically clear to the user\
• Helping the user via instructions, transitions, hide/show, emphasis styling or other creative mechanisms is encouraged\
• Providing a way to reset the application state and/or display a simple state history is encouraged
